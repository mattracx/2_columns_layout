# 2 Columns Responsive Layout - Flutter App

It includes 2 columns (sidebar 260px on the left, main content on the right)
In the main content there is a fixed header 60px and a scrollable GridView

### The app is at a very early stage, mobile layout still not implemented. But it can still be used as a blank template for new apps.
